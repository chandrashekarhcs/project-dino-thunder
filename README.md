## Overview
Project Dino Thunder is a **spooky** web-based informational gallery aimed at educating users about different dinosaurs. The “Thunder” in the title alludes to the rumbling atmosphere of ancient times, complemented by a haunting aesthetic that sets this project apart from typical dinosaur encyclopedias.

### Objectives
- Present a curated list of dinosaurs from various periods (Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous).  
- Offer a “spooky” or “haunted museum” vibe through sound effects, dark color schemes, and subtle animations.  
- Provide quick facts about each dinosaur, including diet, size, and notable features.

---

## Features
1. **Spooky Aesthetic**  
   - Utilizes dark color palettes, eerie background elements, and subtle horror-themed transitions.
2. **Interactive Dino Cards**  
   - Each dinosaur is displayed on a card that reveals additional details on hover or click.  
   - Potential for sound or glow effects to enhance the atmosphere.
3. **Tailwind Animations**  
   - Emphasizes a smooth, cohesive user experience with utility-first styling.  
4. **Lightning-Fast Vite Build**  
   - Rapid development server, hot module replacement, minimal config overhead.
5. **TypeScript Safety**  
   - Helps maintain clean, robust code and reduces runtime errors.

## Tech Stack
- **Vite** – Ultra-fast frontend build tool with near-instant hot module replacement.  
- **TypeScript** – Strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding type-safety features.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for custom and efficient styling.  
- **HTML / JavaScript** – Core web technologies for structure and dynamic behavior.
