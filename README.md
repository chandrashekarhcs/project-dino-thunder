Overview
“Project Dino Thunder” is an apparent boilerplate or framework for a front-end web application. Based on the presence of files like: • vite.config.ts
• tailwind.config.js
• tsconfig.json
• package.json

…it uses the Vite build tool for quick development, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for robust type-checking.

Possible directions for this project include: • Creating a dinosaur-themed website or game.
• Serving as a template for any web project using Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.

Features
Vite Setup
– Fast startup, hot module replacement, minimal configuration.
TypeScript Support
– Safer coding with type-checking.
Tailwind CSS
– Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
PostCSS
– Ensures transforms and optimizations for your CSS.
ESLint
– Helps maintain consistent code style and catch errors early.
Project Structure
Below is a brief description of notable files and folders:

• index.html
– The main entry point for the application.
• package.json
– Lists project dependencies and scripts.
• tsconfig.json / tsconfig.app.json / tsconfig.node.json
– TypeScript configuration files defining how code is compiled.
• tailwind.config.js / postcss.config.js
– Configuration for Tailwind and PostCSS customizations.
• vite.config.ts
– Configuration file for Vite, usually specifies plugins, build optimizations, and more.
• eslint.config.js
– ESLint rules for linting TypeScript/JavaScript code.
• config.json
– May contain project-specific settings (e.g., environment variables, custom config data).
• prompt (assuming it is a folder or file)
– Might be used for automated scripts, resource prompts, or custom build tasks (if at all used in the workflow).

Getting Started

or

yarn dev
Open Your Browser
» Visit http://localhost:5173 (or the URL shown in your terminal) to see the app running.

Scripts & Commands
Here are typical scripts defined in a Vite + Tailwind + TypeScript project (check your package.json for exact commands):

Script	Description
npm run dev	Starts the local development server.
npm run build	Builds an optimized version of the project.
npm run preview	Serves the production build for testing locally.
npm run lint	Runs ESLint to check code quality.
Configuration Files
• vite.config.ts
– Allows customization of the Vite dev server, build output folders, and plugin usage (e.g., Tailwind plugin).

• tailwind.config.js
– A central place to define theme colors, screens/breakpoints, variants, and other Tailwind settings.

• tsconfig.json
– Configures how the TypeScript compiler parses and checks code, including target output and module resolution.

• config.json
– Potentially used for environment or project-specific config. Adjust as needed.

Future Enhancements
• Actual Dino Content
– Add dinosaur data, images, or interactive features if this is truly a dinosaur-themed project.
• Unit & Integration Testing
– Incorporate frameworks like Jest, Vitest, or Cypress for testing.
• CI/CD Integration
– Use GitHub Actions or other services to automatically test and build pull requests.
• Documentation
– Expand this README or create a dedicated docs folder for deeper details on architecture, usage, deployment, etc.
